Tagless Final Testing is a template allowing Functional Programmers to test their Effectual code via the 'Functional Core, Imperative Shell' Testing Pattern.

Although originally conceived to be a Dependency Injection Pattern to resolve the Expression Problem found within FP, Tagless Final's structure of Algebras, Interpreters and Programs allow for a modular approach to testing.

## Use Cases & Context

Tagless Final is a Dependency Injection tool which allows us to embed a DSL into a host language through the use of interfaces and algebras which are specific to the domain we want to model.

Alongside being a modular Dependency Injection tool, Tagless Final's DSL structure allows us to test the side effectual code by following the 'Imperative Shell, Functional Core' API building and testing pattern.

When attempting to build purely functional applications which interact with external dependencies/systems i.e. databases, we encapsulate the operation description of side effectual code in declarative statements such as 'Effects'.

By pushing the business logic to the centre of the application ('Functional Core'), we can utilise Unit Testing of such functions but we also need to test the code that sits on the edge of the application i.e. the side effectual Imperative Shell.

And Tagless Final allows us to model this.
